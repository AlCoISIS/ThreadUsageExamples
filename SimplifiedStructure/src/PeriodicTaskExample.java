// Using threads can simplify the design of programs that need to perform multiple tasks concurrently, such as performing 
// periodic tasks, handling asynchronous events, or managing multiple simultaneous operations.

// In this example, a periodic task is executed in a separate thread, simplifying the main programâ€™s structure by 
// offloading the task management to the thread.
